          </p>
          <h4>Article 10. </h4>
          <p>
            During his stay, the GUEST is obliged to use the facility and its
            equipment with appropriate consideration and care. The GUEST must
            adjust his behavior so as not to disturb other guests, neighbors and
            the host. In the event that the GUEST has not adjusted his behavior
            with the house rules even after a warning, he loses the right of a
            reserved accommodation and must leave immediately, without
            compensation. All damages and defects caused or discovered by the
            GUESTS, must be reported immediately to the owner of VILLA ISTRIA
            VABRIGA. In this way, damages and defects will be removed
            immediately without reducing the quality of the stay. The GUEST is
            responsible for any damage or defects caused by them if it can’t be
            proven otherwise. The same applies if the accommodation unit is not
            available due to damage, dirt or missing equipment, so it can’t be
            rented to the next GUEST. The owner of VILLA ISTRIA VABRIGA will
            charge the GUEST, on the spot, a subsequent fee for any damages or
            defect.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is the GUEST's obligation to conscientiously use the unit and the
            inventory in the facility. On the day of departure, the
            accommodation unit must be in the same condition as it was when the
            GUEST arrived. In case the conditions have changed, the GUEST is
            obliged to immediately inform the owner of VILLA ISTRIA VABRIGA. If
            visible irregularities are not reported immediately upon arrival,
            the unit will be deemed to be delivered in good condition. If during
            the stay the guest experiences any irregularities, it is their
            obligation to act in the same way. If the GUEST leaves voluntarily
            the facility and finds another accommodation without giving VILLA
            ISTRIA VABRIGA enough time to solve the problem which causes the
            GUEST's dissatisfaction, the GUEST loses the right to compensation
            regardless of whether they are justified reasons for leaving or not.
            Claims for compensation must be submitted to VILLA ISTRIA VABRIGA in
            writing within two weeks after using the accommodation unit with
            included proof (photos, confirmation from the person in charge of
            the keys, witness statements, etc.). Complaints will not be
            considered if they are submitted after the expiry of the two-week
            period. If the GUEST does not meet these conditions, he loses the
            right to compensation. VILLA ISTRIA VABRIGA is obliged to submit a
            written decision on the complaint within 15 (fifteen) days from the
            day of receipt of the complaint in the same form (e-mail, regular
            mail or personal delivery by registered mail with return receipt).
